This is an attempt to provide a concise and relevant definition of the product management role

## Introduction
Product Manager (PM) is an elusive and complex role and if you’re starting out it can be rather confusing and overwhelming. Everyone has an opinion about what makes a great PM. Are they the [CEO of the product](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) or rather the [sheepdog](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-products-for/9781492024774/ch01.html), or is the role simply too diverse and contextual to provide a one-fits-all definition. It is a difficult task to (get to the point where you are able to) identify good resources on the subject that help you explore the role for yourself.

This document is an attempt to provide a concise and relevant definition of the product management role, focussing on technology products (more than ever, [software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)). In many ways, I am still starting out myself, so I am writing this for myself as much as for whoever is interested. 

I consider this a living document. There will be revisions whenever I learn something new. I absolutely welcome constructive feedback. It can be a great starting point for a discussion about a very fascinating and often controversially discussed role. 

-----------------------

## What is a Product?
For a [high-level definition](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-is-a-product), “a product is something that is created through a process and that provides benefits to a market.” 

There’s plenty of material out there that tries to slice up and explain in more detail what product is and in turn what the product manager role includes. I found the distinction of [two areas of product, discovery and delivery](https://svpg.com/inspired-how-to-create-products-customers-love/), to be the most sensible and useful approach. 

Product Discovery answers the questions about what products/ features should be built and why. The purpose of product discovery is to avoid building something that isn’t successful by addressing four critical areas in advance.

1. Value - Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it (because it is addressing a problem or want)? 
2. Usability -  Can the user figure out how to use it? Does he enjoy using it?
3. Feasibility - Can we build it? Do we have the resources to build it? 
4. Viability -  Does this solution work for our business, with external constraints in mind? 

Product discovery needs to align with business objectives and the product vision!

Product Delivery is concerned with the process of building the actual solution in a way that guarantees 
1. Performance and Reliability
2. Scalability 
3. Maintainability 
4. Measurability - Supporting user/ customer and performance analytics

Product delivery needs to produce business outcomes (as measured by key results), rather than features.

Product discovery and delivery are not sequential but rather parallel and reciprocal activities throughout the entire product-life-cycle (PLC). They are the means to validate product hypothesis, ranging from product/market fit hypothesis in the beginning of the PLC to feature ideas during growth and maturity. 

This understanding of product development has picked up recently, operating under the term ‘dual-track agile’ or ‘dual-track design’, although terminology and underlying principles [have been around for quite some time](https://svpg.com/dual-track-agile/).

## The Product Manager Role

A product manager (PM) is driving the success of a product by leading and leveraging a cross-functional product team through product discovery and delivery. He does so [without direct authority](https://www.sachinrekhi.com/the-most-underrated-product-management-skill-influence-without-authority). 

The product team should at least include a PM, a product designer and engineers, with market and/or data analysts, QA automation engineers and other functions potentially joining in as well, especially so in larger organizations. 

A PM should promote an atmosphere of inclusiveness, where at least the core team members participate in the whole product development process to some extent. In this spirit, designers and (parts of the) engineers should be included in the product discovery early on, e.g. by joining or conducting customer interviews and by providing expertise in relation to usability and feasibility. PMs and engineers should be included in questions of UX and lastly PMs and designers should make it a point to also understand the technical aspects of the product and the product delivery, again, to some extent.

Regardless of who joins the effort, it is always the PMs responsibility to understand the problem (or want) to be solved by interfacing with the many internal and external stakeholders and utilizing all resources available. They then define the what and why of the “discovered solution” to be delivered by the engineering team and stand-by for clarifications and adjustments during the entire delivery process. The interface with the engineering team can (and maybe should) include some amount of project management if it helps delivery on spec. In any case, PMs should make sure to have a good grasp of the technical solution.  

In cases where project management impedes other product activities, it makes sense to create a dedicated project or delivery management position.  

Lastly, PMs need to utilize product analytics and user research to ensure the success of the delivered solution by measuring against the key results defined. 

All of the above is realized through an iterative process throughout the PLC until the demise of the product. Following the lean principle of avoiding waste, the scope of each iteration is as small as possible, somewhere between a day’s and week's worth of work rather than months. This is important in order to receive feedback fast and quickly understand when and how to adjust or pivot the product. 

### Core PM Competencies

The product development process outlined above encompasses a lot of responsibilities. A PM needs a set of core competencies to tackle them. 

* Create, refine and implement product vision and strategy in alignment with business goals (depending on the level of maturity, this can mean from building from scratch or continuing and refining). 
Keep in mind, also [strategies start out as hypotheses](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/theres-no-guarantee-your-product-strategy-will-work-heres-how-to-de-risk-it/)! 
* Lead product discovery 
  -Curate and develop product ideas and hypothesis
  #Drive product experimentation and prototyping
  *Own customer interviews and user testing
  *Conduct market and industry/ domain research, including competitive analysis
  *Manage and leverage relationship with stakeholders
  *Make heavy use of metrics and own product analytics (business, users/ customers, performance, utilizing OKRs)
* Translate technical-to-business requirements in support of marketing efforts
* Evangelize product internally and externally
* Support the engineering team with project management activities around product delivery 
  *Translate business-to-technical requirements
  *Plan product roadmap
  *Prioritize product backlog
* Promote a culture of open-mindedness, transparency, respect and trust. These are the best prerequisites for innovation, employee retention and top quality products. And it’s much more fun to work like that!

PMs need tools to do all of this and a [PM’s toolbox](https://www.productmanagementtoolkit.com/) can be quite large. Don’t go crazy though and remember that [“tools are just tools”](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/steve-jobs-in-1994-the-rolling-stone-interview-231132/). They should support, not drive decision making. 

### Personal Skills

Maybe the strongest quality of a PM is the ability to analyse, adjust and respond to a specific situation. This includes an exceptional talent to work with and more so, to influence and lead others, again, without exerting direct authority. As a PM you therefore need to invest in a set of personal skills, many of which are powered by [emotional intelligence](https://hbr.org/2017/02/emotional-intelligence-has-12-elements-which-do-you-need-to-work-on#comment-section) (EI). 

* Organizational awareness and empathy towards others which is vital in order to understand your customers, team-members and other internal and external stakeholders 
* Relationship management skills that enable you to influence, inspire and lead other people as well as to establish a culture of teamwork and -communication
* Self-awareness and -control, which is important to understand your strengths and weaknesses and how to leverage them for your work 
* The capability to adapt to new situations fast 
* Drive, grit and achievement orientation
* A positive outlook
* Be an ever curious and diligent learner. This is the ultimate prerequisite for your growing and creating change

### Company-Fit and Types of Product and PMs
Whether PMs are successful doesn’t only depend on them though. It needs the right setup, [the right company](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) and product at the right time. It can help to think about it in terms of [different types of PMs](https://medium.com/earnest-product-management/3-types-of-product-management-dec4b2d77271#.xuhmw0rg5), however, this holds the risk of confining a role that should remain open to change, rather driving change. In any way, there are many aspects to consider here.

#### Company stage/ maturity 
* Startups provide PMs with a broader experience, not only product related. They are likely to be more involved in strategy building, with the prospect of owning the entire life-cycle and they will feel the impact they make on a daily basis. 
On the other hand, there is limited mentoring and guidance. Resources are scarce, which can greatly affect the quality of work and result in sudden lay-offs.
* Mature companies on the other hand provide stability and relatively clear career paths, including mentoring programs. PMs can learn from a working product.
The flipside is a much narrower focus and the feeling of only marginally impacting the business. Also, there are likely more politics and other distractions to deal with.

#### B2B vs. B2C
The below list is meant as a high level comparison of the B2B and B2C sales models. Of course these are generalizations and they don’t have to apply to individual businesses. 
In the context of customer relationships, it seems clear though that B2B generally includes more investment but also a higher return, [more stability and less uncertainties](https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/).


||B2C|B2B|
|---|---|---|
|**Value**|Want|Need|
|**Customer Relationship**|Volatile Hookups|Stable Partnerships|
|**Target Market**|Large|Narrow/ Niche|
|**Buying Process**|Short, Triggers|Long, Complex, Technical|
|**People Involved in Buying**|User|Multiple Personas (not necessarily the users)|
|**CPA**|Low|High|
|**LTV**|Low|High|
|**Product Complexity**|Low|High|
|**Customer Insights**|More Quantitative|More Qualitative|
|**Solution Focus**|UX|Features|
|**Revenue Model**|Freemium,  Ads, In-apps purchase, Subscription|Subscription, License|
|**Release Cycles**|Short|Longer|

#### Cloud vs. On-prem
This looks like an easy one. Cloud-based product delivery is on the rise for some time now and on-premise falls behind, so why even bother? 
There are still some domains that prefer on-premise implementation mainly due to privacy concerns and compliance regulations.This is true for finance, insurance, security and public or large corporate organizations, among others. 

Some of the [major differences](https://beenegarter.com/cloud-vs-on-premise-solutions-which-is-right-for-you/) for PMs to consider:

|On-prem|Cloud-based|
|---|---|
|Longer release cycles (a few times per year)|Shorter release cycles|
|Customized solutions per customer (potentially complex matrix of product versions)|One version fits all|
|Necessary compatibility and integration with customer legacy systems|None to very limited concerns about compatibility. Easy integration via APIs|
|Arduous training and onboarding on-prem|Fast, virtual customer onboarding and adoption|
|In the worst case, no user metrics at all|Whatever metrics you want|

#### Company Leadership 
You want to have a good relationship with the company’s executive team to get buy-in for riskier product endeavors and for important input about the business. Most importantly, you need clarity about the company’s long-term business goals and objectives as this is the starting point for any product development.
On the other hand, you want to retain ownership of the product with limited interference from the  executive team, e.g. being tasked to deliver unvalidated product ideas asap.

#### Product Philosophy
I believe that the best results are achieved in an environment of inclusiveness, transparency and collaboration. PMs should actively promote those values within the product team and company-wide. 
In companies and product teams where processes are biased and decisions are being dominated by one perspective, the output is biased as well and eventually will fail to deliver the desired outcome and achieve and/or maintain product/market fit.
